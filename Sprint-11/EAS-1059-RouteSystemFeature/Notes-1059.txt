When an order placed then the products of order must be routed to the store for fulfillment.
If any ordered item/product is prepared within the Wawa store then its termed as prepared product such as Hoagie, sandwich, milkshake, bowl etc. 
Wawa manufactured item or third-party item which is already packaged and ready to be sold is termed as finished product such as bottle of water, a bag of chips, soda can, prepackaged sandwiches etc.

Any finished product type in the order should be routed to the Store.
1 - Store with nearest location of customer address
2 - Customer can select the store
Any customized product or prepare product in the order should routed to kitchen system
1 - Counter availability of store for prepare item (Prepare product will route to the kitchen system where there will be more counters available.
Based on the load of orders in the counter the corresponding order will route to the counter/work station). 

There will be delivery points from where prepared product and finished product should collect by delivery drivers or customer.
Once the prepared products completed by kitchen counter then it will route to corresponding delivery counters.

2 - Ordered on 3rd party delivery partner sites.


Rule
1 - Counters and delivery points should be a child node of store. Counter determination must be based on Product Type where delivery station will decide by delivery method. 
2 - Manager’s Interface : Store manager will decide to re-assign the delivery points in between customer pickup point  and delivery driver point.
3 - Load Balancing of workcell capacity: For a store with more than one workcell of same type, the work order should be routed to workcell
 having minimum orders in the queue compared to other workcells of same type.
4 - Order wait time notification: Wait time for prepared product should consider the product preparation time and orders in queue.
5 - Future orders: When an order is submitted for fulfillment for a future date/time, 
the order should not get released ASAP to kitchen. The order release should consider the lead time required for preparation (preparation and waiting time). 
6 - Ability to Route products to different RSS (routing by product type)- Configure salads RSS to receive soups, sides, bowls
7 - Ability to show line levels of the Order on the Expeditor and split Order and Route Products to Work Cell
