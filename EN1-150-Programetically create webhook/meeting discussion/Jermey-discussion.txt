Hi Jeremy

For creating a new repository we are adding a .json file with repository name in \admin-toolstack-config\GitHub\RepoConfigs path of github.
Once its merging with master then we are getting the new mentioned repository in github.

Is any script running when merged with master? or its manually somebody running script?

I have one requirement to implement similar stuff

Ans - the process does only run once per hour to process changes after merge.
no it's a scheduled script, so could take up to an hour

    however I did make a change to that process yesterday so if it's not working I will look into it
